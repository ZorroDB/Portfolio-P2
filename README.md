<h2>Heya! This is my portfolio.</h2>
<br>
<p>I am a software engineer. My main languages I like the most (and also write the most in) are Python and Javascript. Also do I have experience in C# (Game dev).</p>
<br>
<p>I am stil sort of new to programming (4 years of experience now) and would like to spend much more time on it. I enjoy solving difficult problems, when things get more difficult, they get more fun.</p>
<br>
<p>Anyways, thanks for reading this. Enjoy my portfolio and if you want to contact me you can do that through the contact page. See ya!</p>
<br>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<br>
<p>Zorro</p>
