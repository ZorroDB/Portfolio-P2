Heya! This is my portfolio.

I am a software engineer. My main languages I like the most (and also write the most in) are Python and Javascript. Also do I have experience in C# (Game dev). 

I am stil sort of new to programming (4 years of experience now) and would like to spend much more time on it. I enjoy solving difficult problems, when things get more difficult, they get more fun. 

Anyways, thanks for reading this. Enjoy my portfolio and if you want to contact me you can do that through the contact page. See ya!
